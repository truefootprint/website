    <h1>TrueFootprint FieldApp Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
    This policy was last modified on and has an effective date of January 27, 2020.
    </p>

    <p>
    TrueFootprint Ltd (“TrueFootprint”, “we” or “us”), a sustainability technology company, respects people’s privacy. The TrueFootprint FieldApp (“the app”) helps our clients collect, manage and analyse data to better achieve their sustainability goals. Our goal is to make our users benefit from the FieldApp directly or indirectly by answering questions about the initiatives paid for by our clients. We empower our users to be changemakers. The purpose of this privacy policy is to help explain to our users, clients, partners, and other stakeholders how we collect, use, retain, and disclose information.
    </p>

    <p>
    We work with implementing partners who recruit users for our FieldApp. They share users’ personal data with us. They act as Data Processor for that data; we act as Data Controller for that data. Through our FieldApp we collect and process additional personal information as a Data Controller. We do not share personal identifiable information with our clients or partners. More details below. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our clients and partners, which may differ from those set forth in this policy. We require our clients and partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide our users with notice of the collection of data as outlined in this policy. To understand how our clients and partners will use personal information, please refer to their relevant privacy policies.
    </p>


    <h2 id="information-we-collect">
    Information We Collect:
    </h2>

    <p>
    Our implementing partners recruit users for us. For each user they collect the name and phone number, as well as the project they will work on, and enter this into our FieldApp Administration Tool. We use this data to prepare a FieldApp configuration for each user, serving each user the appropriate set of questions. Our implementing partners act as Data Processor on our behalf. We are the Data Controller for this initial set of data.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once recruited users download the FieldApp and start it, the app asks them for their phone number to retrieve the correct configuration. The app will then ask the user to answer questions relevant to the initiative they are monitoring. These questions typically do not ask for sensitive data, but it is conceivable that in some projects they will do.
    </p>

    <p>
    The app deploys various tracking technologies to automatically collect certain information about the user’s device and app usage. This includes non-personal identifiable data such as the brand of the device, operating system version, etc. It also includes the user’s IP address and location, certain unique identifiers that may be considered personal data in certain jurisdictions, including the European Economic Area. We collect this information by assigning a random unique identifier (“UID”) to the device the first time the user interacts with our FieldApp. The UID is then used to establish linkages between you and other information we might have on the user, for instance if the user later uses the app on another device.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Location.</strong> Most mobile devices offer you the ability to stop the collection of location information at any time by changing the preferences on your device. You may also be able to stop the collection of location information by particular apps by adjusting the settings for individual apps or following the standard uninstall process to remove specific mobile apps from your device. If you are a resident of the EEA, you have some additional rights which are explained below in “Additional Notice for EEA Residents”.
    </p>

    <h2 id="how-we-use-your-information">
    How We Use Information
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>To provide the relevant experience</strong>. We tailor the set of questions we ask to the type of initiative to be monitored. We use the user’s phone number to look up which questions they should answer.</li>
      <li><strong>To provide our clients with non-personal, aggregated analytics</strong>. We may report to our clients the aggregated answers from a subset of our users, relevant to our clients’ initiatives. We may group these answers and analyses based on location data.</li>
      <li><strong>To provide third parties with insights derived from non-personal, aggregated analysis</strong>. We may analyse answers from all or a subset of users to arrive at insights regarding sustainability initiatives and sell this as a service to third parties.</li>
      <li><strong>To do user matching</strong>. We may use part of a user’s information to try to identify this user even if they have switched devices.</li>
      <li><strong>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate:</strong> (a) under applicable law, including laws outside the user’s country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
      <li><strong>To evaluate, operate or improve the FieldApp</strong>. We aim to provide our users with the best possible experience in order to maximise the benefits our users and clients get from our FieldApp.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="how-we-protect-information">
    How We Protect Information
    </h2>

    <p>
    Personal identifiable information is encrypted before being stored in our database. All the data that we collect, including encrypted personal information, is stored on our behalf by Amazon Web Services (AWS), a global cloud storage provider.
    </p>

    <p>
    Anonymisation and encryption: When we store, transmit and otherwise process personal information such as name and phone number, we make extensive efforts to protect that information from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction and to make sure that anyone with whom we share personal information do the same. These steps include the use of firewalls, network-layer encryption such as SSL and dedicated monitoring systems. We also limit access to personal information to only those employees (our own employees and those of relevant implementing partners) who we believe reasonably need to have access to that information to provide products or services or in order to do their jobs.
    </p>

    <p>
    No guarantee: No data transmissions over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us and users do so at their own risk. Once we receive a transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.
    </p>

    <p>
    Notification: If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify our relevant users electronically so that they can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice on our website if a security breach occurs. We may also send a text message to possibly affected users at the phone number they have provided to us. Depending on where our users live, they may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
    </p>

    <h2 id="how-we-share-your-information">
    How We Share Information
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Partners:</strong> We only share personal identifiable information with our implementing partners in order to troubleshoot any problems a user may have to start the app. We do not share any answers or other personal identifiable information with our partners.</li>
      <li><strong>Clients:</strong> We do not share any personal identifiable information with our clients. We do share  answers with the client whose initiative a user monitored, but these are anonymised.</li>
      <li><strong>Other third parties:</strong> We do not share any personal identifiable information with other third parties. We do share answers, but these are anonymised.</li>
      <li><strong>Administrative and legal:</strong> We may transfer and disclose information, including Usage Data, to third parties: (i) to respond to subpoenas or other legal processes or if in our opinion the disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of any person or entity.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers.</strong> We may disclose and transfer information, including Usage Data: (a) if we assign our rights regarding any of the information to a third party or (b) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of TrueFootprint and/or its parent company ownership interests, assets, or both, bankruptcy or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="data-retention">
    Data Retention
    </h2>

    <p>
    We retain personal identifiable information for no longer than three years from the user’s last app usage. Every time our technology collects new data from a user, this three-year counter starts again. We also retain data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Non-personal identifiable information is kept indefinitely.
    </p>

    <h2 id="international-transfers">
    International Transfers
    </h2>

    <p>
    TrueFootprint is based in the United Kingdom. We and our service providers may transfer information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as the user’s home jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that personal information will remain protected in accordance with this privacy policy, such as requiring our third-party service providers and partners to protect the information in accordance with the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfers of personal information.
    </p>



    <h2 id="additional-notice-for-eea-residents">
    Additional Notice for UK and EEA Residents
    </h2>

    <p>
    If you are a resident of the UK or the EEA, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data. We will only process your personal data when we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. Our implementing partners only recruit users who consent to be a monitor and as such consent to the use of their mobile phone number.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to Contact Us” heading below.
    </p>

    <h2 id="data-subject-requests">
    Data Subject Requests
    </h2>

    <p>
    If you are a resident of the UK or the EEA, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    </p>

    <p>
    To make any of these requests please email privacy@truefootprint.com. We will respond as soon as practicable and no later than one month after receipt of your request.
    </p>

    <p>
    Please note that because most of the information we store can only identify a particular device, and cannot directly identify you personally, you may need to provide us with proof of identification so we can ensure that we accurately fulfill your request and do not infringe on the privacy rights of other individuals. We may deny or restrict fulfillment of your request in some cases, such as when your access to data places another individual’s privacy rights at risk, or the continued processing of your data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation. If so, we will notify you of the reason(s) for this denial.
    </p>
